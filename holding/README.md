# WDI_PROJECT_2
My second General Assembly Web Development Immersive project


##To Investigate
###Data Usage
- What data is available and how should it be used?
- timeToStation can be used as departure time (would also move things 'forward in time to catch up with real life'.
- When a station is clicked a request can be made.  icon released from station after set timeout equal to timeToStation.
- Can trains be uniquely identified from running times?
- Maybe forget animation for now.  Plot symbol with number along line every time it updates!!!!!!!!

##MVP
user can click on station to see incoming trains.  Positions will update each time a push notification is received from the hub.

user can click release train from...
will animate based on time to destination across all stations.

###Hows?
- how to convert curentLocation to offset on map
- get stations from route info
- get meters between from route info
- potentially on one route can set way points at each station 
- need to catalogue each station on line into a percentage / meters of line.
- this is all static info

##Nice to have
some sort of animation smoothing

##Side project
animate one icon along each line with varying speeds
different skins
